Pixel Invaders is a side-scrolling shooter where you take the role of a spaceship to conquer space. Pixel Invaders has gone through 3 different variations of gameplay. 

It was originally an entry to [A 'Tru 2D' Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/a-tru-2d-game-jam), the first game jam I participated in. This version of the game featured 3 enemy types. A gameplay video is provided below.

I expanded onto the game after the game jam. Added more enemy types, a point system, as well as a shop to buy upgrades and customizations. Alongside this, I made ported the game to be touch-screen friendly. Below is a gameplay video from my phone (please excuse the game resolution issue, I hadn't figured out how to do that at the time ðŸ˜…).

Finally, a few years later, I reused Pixel Invaders as part of a school project. This is the version currently available on this page to play.

This new version features stages of enemies, split apart by trivia questions.
