Linear Lab is an interactive tool to help students learn about and visualize complex Linear Algebra concepts.

We offer textbook-formatted lessons, sprinkled with interactive exercises that ensure student's understanding of material.

A sandbox mode is also included to let students explore a visualization of two dimensional linear algebra.

Try it out [here](https://nickjg1.github.io/linear-lab/)!
