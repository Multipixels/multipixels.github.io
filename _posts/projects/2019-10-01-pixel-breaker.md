A game originally made for the [Palette Jam 2 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/palette-jam-2). It's a game spin-off on Brick Breaker style games.

It was originally made over the span of ten days with the main theme of the game jam being to use a limited 8 color palette... but then modified afterwards to polish it off.

### Controls

Only mouse is supported.
