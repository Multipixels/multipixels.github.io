### Game

Crop Rush is a short puzzle game in which the player has to harvest all the crops in the least amount of moves possible. The game is inspired by Club Penguin's <a href="https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Thin_Ice">Thin Ice</a> minigame.

There are 10 total levels, as well as a "Level Rush" mode that's unlocked when the 10th level is finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Try and get as many 3*s as possible and let me know how you do!

### Controls

Only mouse and keyboard is supported.  
Volume can be adjusted in the main menu and pause menu.

Movement: WASD / Arrow Keys&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Pause Menu: ESC / R

### Extra

A game made for the <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52">Ludum Dare 52</a> game jam.

All feedback is welcome and encouraged! This is my first game jam in two years, so my skills were rusty, but I'm happy to have gotten a completed product on time.

V1.2 is the version released for the game jam.  
V1.3 is the post-jam version.

Thank you for playing, please enjoy!!
