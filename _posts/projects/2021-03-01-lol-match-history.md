This League of Legends Match History project was made as part of a Grade 11 project. My goal was to explore how applications can communicate with an API to receive and utilize information. Despite the app being rather barebones, simply saving data locally and displaying certain bits of it, I learned a lot regarding API communication and storing data in JSON.

This project also introduced me to creating project writeups and documentation. Attached below are my two small writeups I submitted as part of my project.
